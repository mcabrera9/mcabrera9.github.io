            <h2>Two-Headed Calf</h2>
  					<p>Series of designs made in Adobe Illustrator for Visual Communication Coursework.</p>
          </header>
          <h3>Project Intro</h3>
  					<p>
              This series of designs was created for an assignment in Digital Media 2: Vector at Loyola University Chicago.
              The designs are based on the poem "Two Headed Calf" by Laura Gilpin.
              The goal of this project was to create a cohesive body of designs based on a piece of literature.
              I chose this poem because of its strong imagery, and the design opportunities that it provides.

  							<h3>Part 1 - Patterns</h3>
  							<p>For the first part of the assignment, we had to create a series of patterns based on the poem. The patterns were then printed on a series of paper cubes.
                The challenge with this exercise was to create a group of dynamic patterns that engaged with three dimensional space while occupying a two dimensional plane.</p>

  							<h3>Part 2 - Poster</h3>
  							<p>For the second part of this project, we were instructed to create a poster to advertise a fictional event based on our chosen text.
                Because the poem I chose talked about watching the stars, I made a poster to advertise a fictional stargazing event.
                I focused the design around the University of Wisconsin-Madison Manfred Olson Planetarium.
                I designed the poster with three sections, each with the Planetarium, to represent a different time during the night of the proposed event.
                This creates the sense of time passing as the viewer reads the poster from top to bottom.

  							<h3>Part 3 - Event Materials</h3>
                  <p>For the third and final part of the project, we were instructed to create materials that would be distributed at the event we created.
                    I chose to create t-shirts, a pamphlet, and a mobile application.</p>
                <h1>T-Shirts</h1>
                  <p>
                    The first piece of event material I created were T-shirts for the event. I used one of my previous patterns as the basis for this design.
                    I chose to create a set of T-shirts because they are a popular event material, and I really enjoyed how one of my patterns looked in T-shirt format.
                  </p>
                  <img src="images/thcshirts.svg" style="width:500px;">
                <h1>Pamphlet</h1>
                <p>I also created a pamphlet for this fictional event because a stargazing event would have a guide for its participants.
                  The tricky part for this piece was to set up the document in a way that would print double-sided correctly.
                  As you can see, I set up bleeds in order to remedy this. Although the images don't align on screen, this set up allowed me to print the document double-sided.

                <h1>Mobile App</h1>
                  <p>Because the event centers around stargazing, I devised an application that would assist users in tracking stars and meteors.
                    For the purposes of this project, I created a protoype of the application.
                    I created the graphics for the application in Adobe Illustrator, and implemented them to a prototype in Adobe XD.
