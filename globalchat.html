        <h3>Project Intro</h3>
                            <h4>Summary</h4>
                            <p>This project is an exploration in UI design and UX research practices as coursework for Computer-Human Interaction under supervision by Loyola University Chicago faculty member Dr. Nicholas Hayward.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Scope</h4>
                            <p>We aim to implement a "post-it style" list. This ties in with the branding of the application, "Host-It," in that we would style the to-do lists and task lists akin to a series of post it notes. The application will also be designed so that a user can log-in as well as customize and save events. This includes  scheduling, sharing, and the coordinating of events. Time permitting, we will add categories and making these events available to other users that have accounts within the application. This would allow users to be invited to events, and grant them the ability to RSVP to events.</p>
                            <h4>Tech Research</h4>
                            <p>We will research React Native in order to develop this application. We do not have prior experience with the framework, so this study will offer us an opportunity to learn and gain experience in React Native. Seeing as our previous MVP was made in Cordova, this study will require a complete rewrite of code. We will implement Firebase data storage, Google sign-in and account creation with Email, and Google Maps API. We will also be using Adobe XD for our prototypes, and we will be using wireframes for the planning process.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Low-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
                            <p>The low-fidelity mockups were done by hand and list out our thought process in the application design. It illustrates all the things we took into account when creating the interface to create a positive user experience. The low-fidelity mockups helped us streamline our ideas and thoughts before jumping into the high-fidelity mockups without much of a plan.</p>

                            <h3>High Fidelity Mockups</h3>
                            <p>The high-fidelity mockups are a reflection of the design choices we made for this application. They illustrate the final product we hoped to achieve. These mockups were created using Adobe XD.

                            <br>
                            <h3>Design Specifications</h3>
                            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/eventpagehi.png" alt="" style="width: 200px;" /></span>Through this mobile application, we wanted to create a mobile application that made a common task of planning easier for people. We wanted to create an application in which a user could plan and organize events all in one place without the hassle of being users of other platorns or connected to other things. The goal of this mobile application is to aid in event-planning for users of all ages. A feature we looked really closely at was Facebook Events, where only Facebook users are able to create and view events. This application removes the barrier of being a Facebook user for those who simply need and event-planning feature. We conducted a survey to see how many people utilized Facebook events and would consider moving it off of the platform to a event-planning specific applications. The people surveyed indicated that they would be very interested in using a event-planning specific application, which is directly aligned with the purpose of this application.
                                Originally this project was created in Cordova and had a working interface, but with the decisions to rebuild it in React Native, we also decided to give the interface an update. We took our old mockups and re-evaluated them to build a more concise application that created a better user experience for the users. We added better navigation through the use of a side menu, also referred to as a “hamburger menu” that shows up if the user taps on the side instead of a navigation bar on the bottom. Using the side drawer allows us to maximize screen space for app content. Additionally, we also tried to keep all elements three taps or less away for a more concise experience for the application user.
                                </p>
                            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/homepagehi.png" alt="" style="width: 200px;"/></span>The application begins with a landing page where they can either login or sign up. After logging in, the user is directed to the Events List page will list all the events that are currently on their calendar. Instead of having some sort of welcome page or something similar, we made the decision to have the Events List page be the page users are directed to after login. We wanted to add to the conciseness to the application and decided that removing a filler page of some sort in between would be the best way to create a positive and simplified user experience. This is in direct contrast to the Facebook Events feature that requires users to locate the tabs and then further navigate to specific events within the Events page to find specific events or create events. We made the creation of a new event very easily accessible by including an add button at the bottom corner of the screen.</p>
                            <p>We decided to use a dark theme for our application because based on our research we found that there were several benefits to having a dark theme for the sake of the user. The dark mode aesthetic is becoming increasingly popular, but it has several advantages besides just the visuals. It is also better for eye strain and reducing eye fatigue. Furthermore, it is more accessible for those with visual impairments, migraines, and visual disorders. Dark themes can also be better for battery life of a device. Furthermore, we used resources such as coolors.co and font-pairing websites such as fontpair.co to make more informed decisions on colors and fonts.</p>
                            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/menuhi.png" alt="" style="width: 200px;"/></span>In our application design, we made several decisions to create a positive user experience. We wanted to simplify the navigation of more traditional event planning options like Facebook events. We researched best UI/UX practices to implement within our design and development. We ultimately made the decision to make changes such as implementing a drawer menu and dark theme to the application. Low-fidelity mockups were created to streamline the ideas we wanted to implement for this application and then we used Adobe XD to create our final high-fidelity mockups that illustrate our final goals.</p>
                            <p>Overall, we learned a lot from the design process and how to prioritize user needs to create an application that can set itself apart from the competition. We learned the importance of various levels of mock-ups in order to make more effective design choices and have a better development process.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Final Considerations</h3>
                            <p>In conclusion, our app helps users plan and organize events by allowing them to schedule and share events with invite lists and to-do list functionalities. It was important to us to make the application user friendly, and to pare down functionality to make it pragmatic and accessible. After conducting research, we were able to find the areas in which the application may succeed in comparison to Facebook's Event page implementation. We used React Native, and achieved the project by implementing modular design. We also implemented APIs such as the Google Maps API and Firebase data storage.</p>
