        <!-- <h3>Project Intro</h3> -->
        <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>This project is an exploration in UI design and UX research practices as coursework for Computer-Human Interaction under supervision by Loyola University Chicago faculty member Dr. Nicholas Hayward.
                              This project was inspired by my personal usage of WhatsApp across timezones, and my interest in finding solutions for the current issues that WhatsApp has.
            </p>
          <br>
          <br>
        <h4>Scope</h4>
            <p>The aim of this study is to practice wireframes, prototyping, and user experience research.
              The scope of this project is to focus on improving the current design, and incorporating additional functionality in an intentional way.
              My redesign will incorporate material design practices and considerations for accessibility.</p>
        <h3>Initial Research</h3>
            <p>To begin this project, I conducted an initial survey to inform my designs.
              I created a survey in Google Forms to gather data about how people use messaging applications to communicate, and how people use those same applications to send messages internationally.
            </p>
            <div id="portfolio-image">
              <img src="images/gcsurvey1.png" style="width:750px;">
              <img src="images/gcsurvey2.png" style="width:750px;">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>From my research, I was able to conclude that users are mostly satisfied with their international messaging experience, but there could be improvement.
              The participants of my research suggested improvements such as better read receipts, and indicators that showed the times at which people in different timezones sent and received messages.</p>
        <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>The low-fidelity mockups were done by hand and list out my initial considerations for how I would like to lay out the design for the group chat settings page and the group chat interface.</p>
          <div style="text-align: center;" id="portfolio-image">
          <img src="images/gcwireframe1.jpg" alt="" style="height: 600px;">
            <!-- <img src="images/lofihi2.jpg" alt="" style="height: 400px;"> -->
          </div>
          <br>

        <h3>Initial Prototype</h3>
            <p>This is the first set of prototypes I developed for this project.
              These screens were produced in Adobe XD.
              The goal with this prototype is to lay out all the features of the redesign.
              I did not incorporate colour because I wanted to first focus on the design before I fine-tune the intricacies of the design.
            </p>
          <div id='portfolio-image'>
            <img src="images/gcw1chatscreen.jpg" alt="" style="height: 400px;">
            <img src="images/gcw1lookup.jpg" alt="" style="height: 400px;">
            <img src="images/gcw1creategroup.jpg" alt="" style="height: 400px;">
            <img src="images/gcw1settings.jpg" alt="" style="height: 400px;">
          </div>
            <br>
          <div>
        <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
             <p>I implemented the logo that I designed in Adobe Illustrator. 
               I also added the official Swiss Railway clock as a placeholder for the clock that would appear in the application. 
               This helps communicate the time zones of different users. I also standardized the fonts across the application to Proxima Nova and Helvetica. </p>

              <img src="images/gcw2creategroup.jpg" alt="" style="height: 400px;">
              <img src="images/gcw2settings.jpg" alt="" style="height: 400px;">
            </div>
            <br>
        <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, the redesign is a comprehensive consideration of Messaging applications and timezone sensitivity. The design was finalized in Adobe XD, and adheres to accessibility principles. The colours provide high contrast, and the design has a sleek look to it. Initially, one of my goals was to implement Material Design. I eventually decided not to implement material design because I did not believe that doing so would truly enhance the design. 

          With several considerations and inspirations, I successfully redesigned WhatsApp with my goals in mind. I implemented timezone sensitivity, and was able to incorporate it in an intelligent manner. My final choices in terms of fonts were informed by the feedback I received during my presentations. I'm happy with the final outcome, and hope to bring this application to life some day.
